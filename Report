1️⃣ Approach
I configured a Jenkins Pipeline project.

Jenkins connects to my personal GitHub repository.

A  Poll SCM is used to automatically trigger the pipeline on code changes.

The pipeline executes multiple stages: Checkout, Build, Test, Deploy, Notify.

2️⃣ Pipeline Details
Stages used:

Checkout

Build

Test

Deploy

Notify

Pipeline Script used:
Pipeline is written directly in Jenkinsfile in my GitHub repository.

3️⃣ Issues Faced
Jenkinsfile syntax errors due to improper braces.

Jenkins not detecting local Jenkinsfile due to case sensitivity (jenkinsfile vs Jenkinsfile).

Git not tracking uncommitted file.

Notify stage failed initially due to SMTP email configuration.

4️⃣ Solutions
Corrected Jenkinsfile syntax (proper closing braces).

Renamed Jenkinsfile properly with capital J to match SCM expectation.

Added file correctly into Git using git mv command.

Modified Notify stage to use echo (simulation) to avoid SMTP configuration.
